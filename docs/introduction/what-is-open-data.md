## Features of Open Data

Open data is not just about sharing any data, there are several features which classifies the shared data as Open Data,

- Fidable
- Accssible
- Interoperable
- Reusable
- Machine readable

### Findable

The data should be categoried with proper metadata. The data and the metadata should be properly indexed and searchable.

### Accssible

The shared data and metadata should be freely accessible using an open protocol. For example the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) which we access the internet on a daily basis.

### Interoperable

The data and metadata should be interoperable, where they provide qualified refereces to other data and metadata.

### Reusable

The data and metadata should be released in license that do not restrict reuse and redistribution of the shared data and metadata.

### Machine Readable

The shared data should be reusable by endusers for use and analysis with minimal effort and processing. Therefore, the data should be shared in a format which is easy for progrmas to use. An example for these file formats include **JSON**, **XML**.

Data shared in a format that is not machine readable are not qualified as open data, these formats include PDF documents, images etc.
